- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @jt-eic (jasun) The mis-spelling is correct, although my phone doesn't seem to think so.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in automation, machine-learning, all things Python, and any way that relates to my current 'job' in broadcast television.
(Plus other things outside of work/coding as well but that's not important here)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning MORE AND MORE about Django back-end stuff, REST framework (still) and now messing with power monitoring, making a handy dashboard, finance/ accounting data automation, or any random topic that seems interesting at the moment.
- No website at the moment (still), its doing some makeover stuff. Plus I have no need for a website now anyway..
