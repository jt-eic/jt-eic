- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @jt-eic (jasun) The mis-spelling is correct, although my phone doesn't seem to think so.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in automation, machine-learning, all things Python, and any way that relates to my current 'job' in broadcast television.
(Plus other things outside of work/coding as well but that's not important here)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning MORE AND MORE about Django back-end stuff, REST framework, and integrating all that with Google calendar... Thats a challenge! Plus building a search engine, a social network, and recipe repository, algo trading, I'm always busy.
- No website at the moment, its doing some makeover stuff.
