- 👋 Hi, I’m @jt-eic (jasun) The mis-spelling is correct, although my phone doesn't seem to think so.
- 👀 I’m interested in automation, machine-learning, all things Python, and any way that relates to my current 'job' in broadcast television.
(Plus other things outside of work/coding as well but that's not important here)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning MORE AND MORE about Django back-end stuff, REST framework, and integrating all that with Google calendar... Thats a challenge! Plus building a search engine, a social network, and recipe repository, algo trading, and I'm always busy.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a project I started in light of the pandemic; which caused a major change in the sports television industry. Ask me more and we can discuss it. I will be posting the work here soon...
- 📫 How to reach me: my personal site jasunthomas.com / jaysquaredsolutions.com is actually down at the moment, so there's that. Othwerwise you can find more on that site.
